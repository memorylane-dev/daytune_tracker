# Daytune Privacy Policy

Effective date: 2025-11-30

This Privacy Policy explains how Daytune (“the App”, “we”, “us”) handles your information.
Daytune is designed to be private by default and offline‑first.

## Summary
- We do not collect, sell, or share your personal data.
- Your data is stored locally on your device and never leaves it unless you choose to export or back it up using your device’s own mechanisms.
- No account is required to use the App.

## Data We Do Not Collect
- No name, email, or contact details
- No advertising identifiers or device identifiers for tracking
- No precise location
- No analytics or usage telemetry sent to our servers (we do not operate app-side servers for this app at this time)

## Data Stored on Your Device
Daytune stores your planning data (e.g., time blocks, categories, progress settings, preferences like custom day rollover) locally on your device’s storage. This data is accessible only to the App and the operating system.

If your device performs system backups (e.g., iCloud backup on iOS, or OEM/Google cloud backups on Android), your data may be included in those backups according to your device settings. We do not control or have access to those backups.

## Optional Sync (Future)
We may introduce an optional, opt‑in sync feature in a future update. If we do, we will provide an updated privacy policy describing what data is transmitted, how it is protected, and your controls and choices. By default, sync will be off.

## Permissions
- Notifications (optional): If enabled by you, we may use system notifications for reminders. Notification content is generated on‑device.
- Network: The App can function fully offline. Network access isn’t required for core functionality.

We do not request access to contacts, photos, precise location, microphone, or camera.

## Third‑Party Services and SDKs
We do not integrate third‑party analytics or advertising SDKs. If this changes in the future, we will update this policy and provide clear opt‑in controls where applicable.

## Children’s Privacy
Daytune is a general‑audience application and is not directed to children. If you believe a child has provided us with any personal information, please contact us and we will take appropriate action. As of now, we do not collect any personal data.

## Data Retention and Deletion
- On‑device data remains on your device until you delete it or uninstall the App.
- Uninstalling the App will remove the App’s local data stored on the device. Device or cloud backups you control may still contain data until you delete those backups.

## Security
We use the device’s local storage. Please keep your device’s operating system up to date and use device‑level security features (e.g., passcode, biometrics) to protect your data. If optional sync is added in the future, we will describe the security controls in an updated policy.

## International Users
All data processing currently occurs on your device. We do not transfer your data to our servers.

## Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Material changes will be reflected by updating the “Effective date” above and publishing the new version with the App and/or on our website (if applicable).
